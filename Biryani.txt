   - In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat ghee and vegetable oil over medium heat.
   - Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter.
   - Add the sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown.
   - Add the marinated chicken and cook until it turns white and slightly browned.
   - Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies. Cook until the tomatoes soften.
   - Add chopped cilantro and mint leaves. Mix well.
   - Layer the partially cooked rice evenly over the chicken mixture.
   - If using saffron, drizzle the saffron milk over the rice.
   - Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes or until the chicken is cooked and the rice is fully done.

4. Garnish and Serve:
   - Garnish the biryani with fried onions (if using).
   - Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip) or a side salad.
